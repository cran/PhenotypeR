diagnosis_of_ankle_sprain,General summary,"A cohort of people with ankle sprains will typically have an average age in the young to middle adulthood range (20s-40s), with a slightly higher proportion of males, particularly if related to sports. Expect to see use of over-the-counter pain relievers like NSAIDs or acetaminophen. Subsequent medication use could include stronger analgesics (opioids, though less common) or occasionally prescriptions for topical creams or bracing.
