diagnosis_of_ankle_sprain,Clinical description,"An ankle sprain is an injury to the ligaments surrounding the ankle joint, typically caused by a sudden twist or impact that forces the ankle out of its normal position. This often occurs during sports, exercise, or even from stepping on an uneven surface.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
diagnosis_of_ankle_sprain,Frequency,"Ankle sprains are a very common musculoskeletal injury, and cases would be identifiable across various healthcare data settings, including primary care, emergency departments, and orthopaedic clinics.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
diagnosis_of_ankle_sprain,Median age of incident cases,"20 to 45 (Ankle sprains are common in active individuals, so the typical age of presentation is likely to be young to middle adulthood.)",cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
diagnosis_of_ankle_sprain,Percentage male,"40% to 60% (Ankle sprains may be slightly more common in males due to higher participation in sports and physical activities, but the distribution is fairly even.)",cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
diagnosis_of_ankle_sprain,Survival at five years,"75% to 95% (Ankle sprains do not directly impact long-term survival. Therefore, the survival rate is expected to be near the general population rate, with any mortality likely stemming from unrelated health conditions.)",cohort_survival,gemini-2.0-flash
diagnosis_of_ankle_sprain,Cohort overlap,"There is expected to be minimal overlap between the ankle sprain cohort and the prostate cancer cohort (0-1%). Some overlap may be expected between the ankle sprain cohort and the new users of morphine cohort (1-5%) due to pain management, and potentially some overlap with long-term pain management strategies.",compare_cohorts,gemini-2.0-flash
diagnosis_of_ankle_sprain,Cohort timing,Individuals may enter the ankle sprain cohort before starting morphine (by several weeks or months) if the sprain leads to chronic pain management. It is highly unlikely that there would be any meaningful relationship in timing with prostate cancer diagnoses. It is unlikely patients would enter all three cohorts. ,compare_cohorts,gemini-2.0-flash
diagnosis_of_ankle_sprain,Frequently seen comorbidities,"Obesity, Osteoarthritis, Peripheral neuropathy, Gout, Plantar fasciitis, Chronic pain, Depression, Anxiety, Hypertension, Diabetes mellitus (These comorbidities are common in individuals who may be less physically active due to ankle issues or are associated with increased risk of falls and injuries.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
diagnosis_of_ankle_sprain,Frequently seen signs and symptoms,"Ankle pain, Swelling, Bruising, Difficulty walking, Tenderness to touch, Stiffness, Instability, Limited range of motion, Popping sensation at time of injury, Joint locking (These signs and symptoms directly relate to the acute injury and the body's response to tissue damage and instability in the ankle joint.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
diagnosis_of_ankle_sprain,Frequently seen medications,"Paracetamol, Ibuprofen, Naproxen, Codeine, Amitriptyline, Gabapentin, Diclofenac, Tramadol, Diazepam, Chondroitin sulfate (Medications used by individuals with ankle sprains would largely focus on pain management and addressing any chronic pain issues or nerve damage that might arise.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
diagnosis_of_prostate_cancer,Clinical description,"Prostate cancer is a malignant tumour that develops in the prostate gland, often driven by hormonal factors and genetic predisposition. It typically begins as a slow-growing, localised disease but can become aggressive and metastasise.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
diagnosis_of_prostate_cancer,Frequency,"Prostate cancer is a common cancer, particularly in older men, and cases can be identified in both primary care and hospital settings, often through screening programmes or investigation of lower urinary tract symptoms.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
diagnosis_of_prostate_cancer,Median age of incident cases,"65 to 72 (Prostate cancer is primarily a disease of older men, with the median age at diagnosis typically in the seventh decade of life.)",cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
diagnosis_of_prostate_cancer,Percentage male,99% to 100% (Prostate cancer almost exclusively affects men because women do not have a prostate gland.),cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
diagnosis_of_prostate_cancer,Survival at five years,"75% to 95% (Survival rates are highly variable depending on stage, grade, and treatment approach, with localised disease having a much better prognosis than metastatic disease.)",cohort_survival,gemini-2.0-flash
diagnosis_of_prostate_cancer,Cohort overlap,"There may be a small overlap (1-5%) between the prostate cancer cohort and the ankle sprain and new user of morphine cohorts, representing cases of prostate cancer patients who experience falls or develop pain requiring morphine. A very small percentage of men may be prescribed morphine for cancer pain relief, but ankle sprains are unlikely to be related to prostate cancer.",compare_cohorts,gemini-2.0-flash
diagnosis_of_prostate_cancer,Cohort timing,"Individuals are likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer many years prior to starting morphine for pain relief. In comparison, there is not likely to be any consistent or temporally linked relationship between diagnosis_of_prostate_cancer and diagnosis_of_ankle_sprain; these cohorts can be considered independent. Individuals with prostate cancer would be diagnosed with prostate cancer prior to the incidence of ankle sprain with a median time of 5 years.",compare_cohorts,gemini-2.0-flash
diagnosis_of_prostate_cancer,Frequently seen comorbidities,"Hypertension, Hyperlipidaemia, Type 2 diabetes, Benign prostatic hyperplasia, Osteoarthritis, Ischaemic heart disease, Chronic kidney disease, Obesity, Depression, Erectile dysfunction (These comorbidities are common in older men, who are at higher risk of prostate cancer, and some may share risk factors with prostate cancer, such as age, obesity and lifestyle factors.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
diagnosis_of_prostate_cancer,Frequently seen signs and symptoms,"Urinary frequency, Urinary urgency, Nocturia, Hesitancy, Weak stream, Haematuria, Bone pain, Erectile dysfunction, Lower back pain, Unexplained weight loss (The signs and symptoms reflect the impact of the tumour on the prostate gland and surrounding tissues, as well as potential metastatic spread to the bones.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
diagnosis_of_prostate_cancer,Frequently seen medications,"Alpha-blockers, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, Bisphosphonates, Analgesics, Antidepressants, Antiandrogens, Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists, Statins, Antihypertensives, Antidiabetic drugs (Medications reflect treatment for prostate cancer (such as antiandrogens and LHRH agonists), management of associated symptoms (such as alpha-blockers for urinary symptoms and analgesics for pain), and treatment of common comorbidities (such as antihypertensives, statins and antidiabetic drugs).)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
new_user_of_morphine,Clinical description,"New use of morphine indicates the initiation of opioid therapy, commonly for moderate to severe pain resulting from acute injuries, post-operative discomfort, or chronic conditions like cancer or musculoskeletal disorders. It signifies that a patient is starting on a potent analgesic medication to manage pain that has not been adequately controlled by other treatments.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
new_user_of_morphine,Frequency,"New users of morphine are moderately common, particularly in settings managing post-operative pain, cancer pain, or chronic pain; cases can be identified in both primary care and hospital data.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
new_user_of_morphine,Median age of incident cases,"60 to 75 (Incident cases are typically older adults experiencing age-related musculoskeletal issues, cancer-related pain, or post-operative pain.)",cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
new_user_of_morphine,Percentage male,"40% to 60% (The proportion of males and females may vary based on the underlying conditions leading to morphine use, with a slight inclination towards males due to higher incidence of certain pain-related conditions.)",cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
new_user_of_morphine,Survival at five years,35% to 65% (Mortality is variable depending on the underlying cause of pain and the presence of other comorbidities; survival is reduced due to underlying conditions and potential complications from long-term opioid use.),cohort_survival,gemini-2.0-flash
new_user_of_morphine,Cohort overlap,"We can expect a small overlap (1-5%) with ankle sprain, as morphine might be used for severe acute pain, a small overlap (2-8%) with prostate cancer, given that morphine is used for cancer pain management.",compare_cohorts,gemini-2.0-flash
new_user_of_morphine,Cohort timing,"The new_user_of_morphine cohort will typically be after the diagnosis_of_ankle_sprain (days/weeks), could be before, after, or concurrent to diagnosis_of_prostate_cancer (years). This is because morphine is often started after an injury such as an ankle sprain, or may be initiated around the time of a cancer diagnosis or later in the course of the illness.",compare_cohorts,gemini-2.0-flash
new_user_of_morphine,Frequently seen comorbidities,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Osteoarthritis, Depression, Anxiety, Hypertension, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Ischaemic heart disease, Chronic kidney disease, Back pain, Fibromyalgia (These comorbidities are common in individuals requiring morphine due to the presence of chronic pain conditions (osteoarthritis, back pain, fibromyalgia) or conditions often managed with opioids, and other conditions which may be associated with increased pain sensitivity or are more common in older populations.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
new_user_of_morphine,Frequently seen signs and symptoms,"Pain, Constipation, Nausea, Drowsiness, Dizziness, Confusion, Respiratory depression, Pruritus, Urinary retention, Dry mouth (These signs and symptoms are associated with the initiation of morphine due to its analgesic and side effect profiles.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
new_user_of_morphine,Frequently seen medications,"Paracetamol, Ibuprofen, Amitriptyline, Gabapentin, Tramadol, Codeine, Diazepam, Omeprazole, Atorvastatin, Bisoprolol (These medications are commonly used for pain management (paracetamol, ibuprofen, tramadol, codeine), neuropathic pain (amitriptyline, gabapentin), anxiety (diazepam), gastroprotection (omeprazole), and cardiovascular conditions (atorvastatin, bisoprolol) often seen in older adults.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
